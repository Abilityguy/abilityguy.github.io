I am currently collaborating with [Prof. Ilija Bogunovic](https://ilijabogunovic.com/) at University College London on distributionally robust optimization in preference learning.
Prior to this, I was a Research Fellow (Pre-Doctoral researcher) at Microsoft Research, India working with [Dr. Nagarajan Natarajan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/nagarajn/) and [Dr. Sayak Ray Chowdhury](https://sites.google.com/view/sayakraychowdhury/) working on problems in robustness and black-box optimization.
Prior to my role at Microsoft, I worked at Google on the Data Commons project, contributing to making public datasets more accessible and usable. I hold a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from PES University, where I graduated with honors.
