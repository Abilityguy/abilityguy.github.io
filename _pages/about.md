I am a PhD student at Boston University, currently rotating with [Aldo Pacchiano](https://www.aldopacchiano.ai/). Prior to joining BU, I worked on pluralistic alignment with [Ilija Bogunovic](https://ilijabogunovic.com/) at University College London. Before that, I was a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India, where I worked with [Nagarajan Natarajan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/nagarajn/) and [Amit Sharma](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/amshar/) on problems in AI Alignment and building adaptive learning systems.
