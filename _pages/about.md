I am currently a Research Fellow (Pre-Doctoral researcher) at Microsoft Research, collaborating with [Dr. Nagarajan Natarajan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/nagarajn/) and [Dr. Gaurav Sinha](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/gauravsinha/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of Statistics, Machine Learning, and Optimization.

Previously, I spent a year working at Google on the [Data Commons](https://datacommons.org/) project. I completed my undergraduate studies at [PES University](https://pes.edu/), majoring in Computer Science Engineering. During my undergraduate years, I interned at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Intel Corporation, and Hi-Tech Robotic Systemz.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing table tennis and video games ðŸ˜„.
