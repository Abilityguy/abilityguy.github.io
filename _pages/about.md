My research focuses on building machine learning systems that can adapt and generalize robustly in real-world scenarios. I am currently collaborating with Prof. Ilija Bogunovic at University College London, working on pluralistic AI alignment.
Previously, I was a Research Fellow (Pre-Doctoral researcher) at Microsoft Research India working with [Dr. Nagarajan Natarajan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/nagarajn/) and [Dr. Amit Sharma](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/amshar/) on problems in AI Alignment and building adaptive learning systems. 
I hold a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from PES University, where I graduated with honors.
