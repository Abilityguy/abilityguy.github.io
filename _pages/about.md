Hi, I am Anush! I am currently working on AI Safety and Alignment. Recently, I was a Research Fellow (Pre-Doctoral researcher) at Microsoft Research, working on different problems at in Statisitcs, Machine Learning, and Optimization. 

Previously, I spent about a year working at Google on the [Data Commons](https://datacommons.org/) project. I completed my undergraduate studies at [PES University](https://pes.edu/), majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. During my undergraduate years, I interned at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Intel Corporation, and Hi-Tech Robotic Systemz.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing table tennis and video games.
